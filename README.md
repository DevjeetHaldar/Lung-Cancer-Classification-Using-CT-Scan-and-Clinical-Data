# Lung-Cancer-Classification-Using-CT-Scan-and-Clinical-Data

Early detection of lung cancer is vital for improving survival rates, yet the complexity of analyzing medical imaging data alongside clinical information poses significant challenges. Traditional methods often focus on imaging alone, which may miss complementary cues present in patient metadata. 
To address this gap, this project develops a multi-modal deep learning framework that integrates low-dose CT (LDCT) scans with clinical attributes to classify the malignancy of lung nodules.
